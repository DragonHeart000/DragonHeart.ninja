<p>I am Riley Shumway, an aspiring game developer. I recently graduated from West High School and am currently trying to dedicate more time to learn more about coding and to spend time working on actual projects. I took all the Computer Science classes at my school and even one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison after exhausting my schools' computer science curriculum. I am proficient in C#, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Batch Scripting. I love programming, but I do dabble in all fields from 3D modeling all the way to Video FX. It's hard to give credit to a single event in my life that made me love coding since I have played video games my entire life. One event that I feel may have caused me to want to pursue a job in technology was in 6th grade when we made simple programs in scratch, and I enjoyed it quite a lot, so I downloaded it at home and did that for hours. After that, I continued to get more and more into computer games and just technology in general, so when I got into High School and felt I needed a job I looked for something that would teach me a lot, and that's how I ended up working at Madison Geeks doing computer repair. Although it's not directly software or game development related I still enjoy working there quite a bit and have learned a lot about technology in the years I have been there. It's still very early in my career so I am trying to use this time to learn as much as I can about coding and make the best of what I have. I love to learn about coding and technology, and I know I have just barely scratched the surface of my potential.</p>
